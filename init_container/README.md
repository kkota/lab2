> Leverage Init Containers to provision dictionaries for a Dictionary service.

1. Define a pod using the following Docker image: k8sland/dictionary-svc-go:0.0.2
2. The dictionary service is launched using the following command:
   ```shell
   /app/dictionary -a dictionary_dir -d dictionary_name
   ```
3. This service runs on port 4000 and exposes /words endpoint to list out the words
   contained in the dictionary loaded via *-d* option above.
4. Define an init container to prepopulate a volume to be used by the dictionary
   service
5. Your init container will need to clone this repo [Dictionaries](https://github.com/k8sland/dictionaries.git) in order to provision the volume
6. Edit the pod and change the init container command to cause the pod to fail
7. What's happening with your dictionary pod?

## Commands

1. Launch your pod
    ```shell
    kubectl apply -f dictionary.yml
    ```
1. Verify the init container is successful and pod is launched
    ```shell
    kubectl get po
    ```
1. Verify the volume was provisioned correctly
    ```shell
    kubectl exec -it dictionary -- wget -q -O - http://localhost:4000/words
    ```
1. Change git url so that it does not resolve
    ```
    kubectl delete -f dictionary.yml --force --grace-period=0
    kubectl apply -f dictionary.yml
    ```
