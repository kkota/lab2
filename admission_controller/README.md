> Trick or Treat? Provision your cluster with a dynamic admission controller
> that rejects all Grim Reaper's deployments!

1. Update the code in main.go to reject all grim reaper deployments. ie
   check for deployment resource with a label app=grim reaper.
2. Generate certs and keys for your webhook and make sure to provide the correct
   service name in your certificate encryption
3. Generate a ca_bundle to validate api-server callback into your webhook.
4. Set the ca_bundle in k8s/adm.yml to the output of the previous command
5. Deploy your admission controller
6. Register your validating admission controller with the api-server
7. Update the provided fred deployment with the magic label and provision your cluster
8. Trace the api-server logs and your admission controller logs to ensure all
   are working nominally.
9. Verify your deployment was denied for the right reason
10. Delete your deployment and change or remove the label
11. Redeploy and make sure your admission controller allows the new deployment
12. Delete your application!
