> The dev team has been hard at work and came up with a new set of dictionaries
> for the company flagship product *Hangman*. The Hangman game is composed of
> 2 HTTP services: hangman and dictionary. The dictionary service serves a
> collection of words. The hangman service calls the dictionary to get a list
> of words, picks a random word and seeds the guessing game with that word.

In this lab we're going to setup an ingress controller to allow us to play
*Hangman* from two separate microservices stacks and leverage a *Traefik* ingress
to mutiplex across our the two stacks.

1. Provision your cluster with a Traefik ingress via a daemonset
1. Deploy hangman v1 and v2 using the provided manifest
1. Verify you can access the Traefik UI
1. Create an ingress resource that allows to switch between the 2 instances of
   the hangman service. Leverage named hosting, setup the ingress to direct
   traffic to either the **trump** version (v1) or the **halloween** version (v2)
1. Verify the Traefik UI displays the correct backend/frontend
1. Play the game using hangman v1
1. Play the game now using hangman v2
1. Make sure both instanced are serving the correct dictionaries!
1. Delete your application
